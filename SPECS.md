# Specifications

## Project Overview
Yet Another Streamer Helper (YASH) is a unified platform manager for YouTube, Twitch, and Kick streaming services that handles authentication, communication, and stream management with a standardized interface.

## Goals
- Usable TUI
    * Command /settings to configure display of UI elements etc...
        * Element : Number of viewers
            * displayed: on/off
            * mode: per platform/cumulative/both
        * Window (as sidebar) showing events/triggers/stuff with platform prefix (if more than one)
        * Window showing messages with platform as header (if more than one)
        * Window showing all messages with platform as prefix (if more than one)
        * Element : Platform connected as Status bar — single borderless line starting with "Status" label, each platform shown as `platform: STATUS (Xh Xm Xs/viewers)` in green (authenticated) or red (not authenticated); unauthenticated providers display `LOGGED OUT` instead of `OFFLINE`; elapsed time and viewer count `(Xh Xm Xs/x)` only shown when platform is ONLINE, `viewers.visible` setting is true (default), and per-platform `showViewers` is not false in `settings.json`
        * Message box
            * position : top/bottom/hide
        * Element : Title (YASH heading)
            * visible: true/false (default: false, toggle with `/settings set title.visible true`)
    * Command /connect [youtube|twitch|kick|obs] to launch connection to platform with auth+save secrets in config
    * Command /exit - exits the application cleanly (TUI only)
    * Command /help - lists all available commands
        * Command /info - fetches current stream/channel info from all providers and prints one `[system] <platform>: …` line per provider in the TUI chat; Kick output also includes current event subscriptions
    * Command /logs [clear|tail <n>|visible <true|false>] - manage log display (TUI only)
    * Command `/chat clear <all|messages|events|logs>` - clear matching live entries from the TUI Chat pane without affecting persisted history
        * `messages` clears visible chat messages and the raw-message cache used by browse/chatter actions
        * `events` clears non-message operational entries currently shown in the Chat pane
        * `logs` clears log-style entries currently shown in the Chat pane
        * `all` clears all Chat pane entries together
        * Available from both the live TUI and IPC (`bun run cmd`) because it does not open a modal or mutate persisted state; it does not clear the merged "Events & Logs" sidebar
    * Command /msg <all|youtube|twitch|kick> <text> - sends a message to the specified platform(s)
    * Command /marker [description] [| timestamp_s] - places a stream marker on all platforms
        * Optional description (chapter label, max 140 chars on Twitch)
        * Optional pipe-delimited timestamp in seconds from stream start (used by YouTube for chapter generation; ignored by Twitch which sets position server-side; Kick does not support markers)
        * When no timestamp is provided, YouTube derives the marker position from the current live stream elapsed time when available, falling back to a live API lookup after restart before using `0`
        * TUI output should collapse provider results into a single `[marker] ...` summary line
        * Examples: `/marker Intro | 0`, `/marker Q&A | 3723`, `/marker` (unnamed, no timestamp)
    * Command `/markers clear | [all|youtube|twitch|kick] [limit]` - lists existing markers per platform or clears persisted YouTube chapters
        * `clear` removes only YouTube chapter markers persisted under `stream.chapters` in `YASH_DATA_DIR/settings.json`
        * Default list target is `all`; default list limit is `20`
        * Examples: `/markers`, `/markers youtube`, `/markers twitch 5`, `/markers clear`
    * Command /settings [get <key>|set <key> <value>] - get or set UI settings; running `/settings` with no arguments opens a TUI modal for display/sidebar/viewer preferences and persists changes to `settings.json`
        * Includes `chat.timestamps.visible` for WebUI unified chat timestamp display
    * Command `/activity` — opens the activity bar modal showing the full event history (follow, sub, cheer, raid) with platform labels and timestamps (TUI only)
    * Command `/inject <platform> <username> <message>` — injects a fake incoming chat message for dev/testing without a live platform connection (TUI only)
    * Command `/setup-youtube` — opens the YouTube stream setup modal (TUI only); configure chaptering, auto-start marker, sync delay, tags, description, subject, and playlist
    * `/stream` modal: per-platform category autocomplete with ↑/↓ navigation — Twitch field (`twitchGame`) calls `/api/twitch/categories` with 300 ms debounce; Kick field (`kickCategory`) calls `/api/kick/categories` with 300 ms debounce; YouTube field uses a static `<select>` dropdown from `/api/youtube/categories`; YouTube Subject field (`game`) shows playlist suggestions from `youtube.searchPlaylists()` (client-side filter of `listPlaylists()`) with 300 ms debounce and a `(new)` indicator when the typed text doesn't match any existing playlist exactly
    * Message box to send message to [all|youtube|twitch|kick] platform and receive command "/" (without sending to platforms)
        * Input history: Up/Down arrow keys navigate previously-sent messages (like a shell history)
        * Plain messages (input not starting with `/`) show a target preview `all|youtube|twitch|kick > message`; `Tab` cycles between `all` and currently connected providers before sending
        * After a successful Twitch send, the chat panel also appends a local self-echo incoming line so Twitch matches the visible send/echo behavior of the other providers
        * Command parameter autocomplete: after typing a command + space, Tab completes available parameters
            * `/connect ` → `youtube | twitch | kick`
            * `/msg ` → `all | youtube | twitch | kick`
            * `/settings ` → `get | set`; `/settings get/set ` → setting key list
            * `/logs ` → `clear | tail | visible`
        * Single-match autocomplete on Enter: if only one command or argument matches the current input, pressing Enter executes that completion directly without needing Tab first
    * Chatter info modal: left-click any chat message, or press Enter while in browse mode (↑/↓ to select a message), to open a modal showing:
        * Platform profile info fetched via `provider.fetchChatterInfo()` (subscriber count, video count, account age, description, avatar URL)
        * Session stats: number of messages sent this session and time first seen
        * Last 200 messages from the persistent message log (cross-session history)
        * Dismiss with Escape or q; modal is exclusive (only one open at a time)
    * TUI Layout
        * Single-line borderless status bar showing all platforms + OBS connection status on one horizontal row; stream status color-coded per platform
        * Chat panel occupies center/maximum space (flex-grow), horizontal layout with right sidebar
        * Events and logs merged into a single "Events & Logs" right sidebar panel
        * Message input box always visible with border/title, rendered before typing begins
- Usable webviews
    * Route / to show controls of the app and stream setup info
        * Title (youtube,twitch,kick)
        * Description (youtube)
        * Notification (twitch)
        * Tags (youtube,twitch,kick)
        * Subject/Category/Game (youtube,twitch,kick)
        * Platform-specific category fields: `twitchGame` with datalist autocomplete (calls `/api/twitch/categories`); `kickCategory` with datalist autocomplete (calls `/api/kick/categories`); YouTube category `<select>` dropdown (populated from `/api/youtube/categories`)
        * Status bar shows per-platform elapsed time + viewer counts, auto-refreshes every second
    * Route /unified to show unified view of all chats
        * Message box supports all applicable / commands: `/help`, `/msg`, `/marker`, `/markers`, `/connect`, `/settings`
        * Status bar shows per-platform elapsed time + viewer counts
        * URL querystring configures initial state and stays in sync as options change: `?position=top|bottom|hide` overrides stored position; `?platform=all|youtube|twitch|kick` sets initial target platform; toggling either option updates the URL via `history.replaceState`
    * Route /sidebyside to show view of chats side by side with config options to enable any platform (saved in browser); URL querystring configures initial state and stays in sync: `?position=top|bottom|hide` overrides stored position; `?platforms=youtube,twitch,kick` (comma-separated subset) sets visible columns; toggling either option updates the URL via `history.replaceState`
        * Message box supports all applicable / commands: `/help`, `/msg`, `/marker`, `/markers`, `/connect`, `/settings`
    * All chats view must have a message box to send messages like TUI, display top/bottom/hide (saved in browser individually)
        * Input history: Up/Down arrow keys navigate previously-sent messages
        * Inline parameter hints while typing a `/` command (shows valid next tokens below input)
    * WebUI commands available in all chat message boxes (`/`, `/unified`, `/sidebyside`):
        * `/help` — list available commands (fetched from `/api/help`)
        * `/msg <all|youtube|twitch|kick> <text>` — send targeted platform message
        * `/marker [description] [| timestamp_s]` — create stream marker on all (or selected) platforms
        * `/markers clear | [all|youtube|twitch|kick] [limit]` — list existing markers or clear persisted YouTube chapters
        * `/connect <youtube|twitch|kick|obs>` — authenticate a platform (all three redirect to real OAuth flows)
        * `/settings get <key>` — read a persistent setting via `/api/settings`
        * `/settings set <key> <value>` — write a persistent setting via `/api/settings`
    * TUI-only commands (not available in WebUI or via CLI IPC): `/exit`, `/logs`, `/info`, `/stream`, `/setup-youtube`, `/history`, `/activity`, `/inject`, bare `/settings` (no arguments), `/chatter` (modal path)
- Scriptable CLI interface via IPC
    * `bun run cmd <command> [args...]` — forwards a command to the running yash TUI process and prints its output to stdout, then exits
    * Both `/cmd` and `cmd` argument forms are accepted (the leading `/` is inserted automatically if omitted)
    * Prints `yash is not running` to stderr and exits with code 1 when yash is not active (socket absent or connection refused)
    * Commands available over IPC: `/marker`, `/markers`, `/settings get <key>`, `/settings set <key> <val>`, `/connect`, `/msg`, `/help`, and most non-modal commands
    * Commands blocked over IPC (require the live TUI): `/exit`, `/stream`, `/setup-youtube`, `/history`, bare `/settings`, `/chatter`

## Out of scope (do not touch)
- Contributing
- Secrets security (encryption at rest, key rotation, OS keyring integration)
- OS keyring integration (keytar) and related token migration scripts
- Encrypted token storage and encryption-based admin key export/import (hybrid RSA+AES packages)
- Repository pre-commit hook installer and .githooks management (pre-commit hook installer scripts)
- Any feature that depends on native keyring binaries or OS-specific keyring modules
- Automatic migration/backup tooling for encrypted secrets
- manifest/checksum generation, signing and verification, ownership remediation

## Deliverables
* Screenshots of webviews made with playwright
* Gif of TUI made with VHS

## Documentation Requirements
- `README.md` must contain a Mermaid diagram describing the `/stream` command validation and execution flow end to end
- The Mermaid diagram must cover, at minimum:
    * target platform selection
    * config persistence
    * per-provider validation / target resolution
    * YouTube mutable-broadcast selection or fallback creation/bind flow
    * provider update success / warning / error outcomes
- Any change to `/stream` validation, provider targeting, fallback behavior, or update sequencing must update that Mermaid diagram in `README.md` in the same change

## Technical Requirements

### Runtime and Testing
- Must use [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the runtime and test runner (`bun run`, `bun test`)

### Linting and Formatting
- Must use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting (`biome check --write`)

### UI Components
- Must use https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui for UI components in terminal

### Logging
- All log output is written to both stderr (console) and `~/.yash/yash.log` (file transport)
- The file always includes an ISO 8601 timestamp even when the console formatter omits it
- Log file is rotated when it exceeds 10 MB (renamed to `yash.log.1`); data directory defaults to `~/.yash` and can be overridden via `YASH_DATA_DIR`

### Architecture
- Provider abstraction layer with common `PlatformProvider` interface
- Individual implementations for YouTube, Twitch, and Kick platforms
- Modular service layer (AuthService, ChatService, StreamService, ObsService)
- Event-driven architecture for real-time communication
- Token storage for authentication credentials (file-backed). Encryption/keyring-based storage is considered out of scope for this build.
- OBS-studio integration via obs-websocket library
- Runtime bootstrap config is stored in `YASH_DATA_DIR/config.json` (default `~/.yash/config.json`); mutable runtime settings are stored in `YASH_DATA_DIR/settings.json`; if the runtime config file does not exist yet and a legacy `[root]/config.json` is present, YASH migrates it once on startup and then moves mutable runtime state into `settings.json`
- TUI and web server run as a single process (`bun run src/index.tsx`); `index.tsx` imports `index.ts` as a side-effect to start `Bun.serve` in the same process. Running them as separate processes causes port 3000 conflicts.
- `Bun.serve` must use `development: false`. In development mode, Bun writes HTML bundle timing lines (e.g. `Bundled page in 31ms: index.html`) directly to fd 1 via native I/O, bypassing both `process.stdout` and the JS `console.*` API. Since `@opentui` renders the TUI on that same fd, these writes bleed into the TUI display and cannot be intercepted at the JS level. `development: false` suppresses this output; HMR is intentionally disabled as a result.
- An IPC server (`src/ipc/server.ts`) is started after `initializeServices()` completes; it listens on a Unix Domain Socket at `YASH_DATA_DIR/yash.sock`. It cleans up any stale socket file on startup and removes the socket on `process.on('exit')`. SIGTERM is handled alongside SIGINT for a clean shutdown.
- IPC protocol: one-round-trip newline-delimited JSON — request `{"command":"<cmd>"}`, response `{"ok":true,"output":"<text>"}` or `{"ok":false,"error":"<msg>"}`.
- Socket path is resolved by `src/ipc/socket-path.ts` as `path.join(getDataDir(), 'yash.sock')`.
- `commandHandlers` in `src/index.tsx` accept an `emit: (line: string) => void` callback so the same handler logic serves both TUI rendering and IPC output collection. TUI path: `(line) => lastMessages.push(line)`; IPC path (`handleCommandForCli()`): `(line) => lines.push(line)`, joined and returned as the response `output`.

### Platform Support
- YouTube: Real OAuth2 integration via Google Data API v3
    * OAuth2 Authorization Code flow; tokens persisted to `~/.yash/youtube_tokens.json`; access token auto-refreshed before expiry
    * `getAuthUrl()` / `handleOAuthCallback(code)` — browser-based consent flow; callback at `GET /api/youtube/callback`
    * `updateStreamMetadata()` — updates live broadcast title/description via `liveBroadcasts.update` (GET + PUT to preserve all snippet fields)
        * Only mutable broadcasts (`created`, `ready`, `testing`, `live`) may be targeted; completed/revoked broadcasts must never be mutated by `/stream`
        * If no mutable broadcast exists for the configured stream key, YASH creates a new fallback broadcast via `liveBroadcasts.insert`, binds it to the saved stream via `liveBroadcasts.bind`, and then applies metadata updates to that new broadcast
        * Limitation: the public YouTube Live Streaming API requires `snippet.scheduledStartTime` on insert, so this fallback cannot perfectly match Studio's unscheduled "Direct stream" object; it may briefly exist as an upcoming broadcast before going live
        * Verified behavior: Studio can create a `ready` "Direct stream" broadcast with `snippet.scheduledStartTime = null`, but public `liveBroadcasts.insert` rejects Unix epoch zero (`1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`) with `invalidScheduledStartTime`; YASH therefore cannot reproduce Studio's unscheduled direct-stream sentinel through the public API
        * If no broadcast target exists, returns diagnostics instead of a silent YouTube no-op; diagnostics include up to the last 10 broadcasts grouped as `active`, `scheduled`, and `all`
    * `sendMessage()` — posts to live chat via `liveChatMessages.insert`
    * Live chat receive uses `liveChatMessages.streamList` over gRPC, resuming with `nextPageToken` after reconnects and skipping initial pre-connect history to avoid replaying old messages in YASH
        * Runtime safeguard: YASH pauses reconnects for 60 minutes after quota exhaustion and stops the stream immediately when YouTube reports that the live chat ended or no longer exists
    * Status polling (60 s interval) — detects active broadcast, updates `streamStatus`, viewer count from `liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers`
    * In-memory chapter/marker store: `createMarker(description?, timestamp?)` stores `StreamMarker` objects
    * `getChapterDescriptionBlock()` serialises chapters to YouTube timestamp format (`0:00 Intro\n1:23 Q&A\n...`)
    * `getMarkers(options?)` — returns last N markers (default limit 20), filterable by `videoId`
    * `clearMarkers()` resets the chapter store (e.g. at stream end)
    * Each marker creation also re-syncs the current YouTube video/broadcast description so the timestamps block is persisted immediately while live
    * Chapter markers are also persisted in the runtime `settings.json` at `stream.chapters` and reloaded on startup so YASH keeps chapter context across restarts
    * `getChannelInfo()` — returns `{ channelId, channelTitle, broadcastId, liveChatId }`
- Twitch: OAuth2-only integration (no RTMP stream key)
    * Real OAuth2 Authorization Code flow; tokens auto-refreshed and persisted to `~/.yash/twitch_tokens.json`
    * Helix API: update channel title, game/category (resolved by name → ID), tags
    * Stream markers via Helix `POST /helix/streams/markers` (requires channel live); returns position in seconds and marker ID
    * Read markers via Helix `GET /helix/streams/markers` — filterable by videoId
    * Chat via `@twurple/chat` (IRC-over-WebSocket): send and receive messages with badge/color metadata
    * EventSub WebSocket: `stream.online`, `stream.offline`, `channel.update`, `channel.chat.message`
    * Stream status seeded from Helix on EventSub connect (handles case where stream was already live when app started)
    * Viewer count polled from Helix every 60 seconds
    * `searchCategories(query, limit?)` — calls Helix `/search/categories` paginated
- Kick: Real OAuth 2.1 PKCE integration via `@nekiro/kick-api`
    * OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow (code verifier/challenge generated locally); tokens persisted to `~/.yash/kick_tokens.json`; pending PKCE verifier persisted to `~/.yash/kick_pending_auth.json` (10-minute TTL, survives restarts)
    * `getAuthUrl()` / `handleOAuthCallback(code)` — browser-based consent flow; callback at `GET /api/kick/callback`
    * `updateStreamMetadata()` — updates title/category/tags via Kick channels API
    * `sendMessage()` — posts to chat via kick-api chat module
    * Incoming chat receive is not supported (kick-api has no real-time message events at MVP level)
    * Status polling (60 s interval) — viewer count from livestreams endpoint
    * `createMarker()` returns `null`, `getMarkers()` returns `[]` — Kick has no marker API
    * Required OAuth scopes: `user:read`, `channel:read`, `channel:write`, `chat:write`, `events:subscribe`
    * `searchCategories(query, limit?)` — live search via Kick categories API
    * `setupWebhooks()` starts a smee.io relay, then ensures the app is subscribed to `chat.message.sent` via `GET/POST /public/v1/events/subscriptions`; the public relay URL is logged at startup and available via `getWebhookUrl()` — register this URL in Kick's developer app settings
    * `handleWebhookEvent(payload)` — dispatches incoming Kick chat webhook events into the chat stream

### Configuration
Bootstrap config is stored in `YASH_DATA_DIR/config.json` (default `~/.yash/config.json`). Mutable runtime state is stored in `YASH_DATA_DIR/settings.json`. If the runtime config file does not exist yet and a legacy `[root]/config.json` is present, YASH migrates that legacy file once on startup and then moves mutable settings into `settings.json`. Environment variables take precedence over config file values.

```json
{
  "obs": {
    "websocket": {
      "server": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": "4455",
      "password": ""
    }
  },
  "platforms": {
    "youtube": {
      "enabled": true,
      "streamKey": "",
      "clientId": "",
      "clientSecret": "",
      "redirectUri": "http://localhost:3000/api/youtube/callback"
    },
    "twitch": {
      "enabled": true,
      "streamKey": "",
      "clientId": "",
      "clientSecret": "",
      "redirectUri": "http://localhost:3000/api/twitch/callback"
    },
    "kick": {
      "enabled": true,
      "streamKey": "",
      "clientId": "",
      "clientSecret": "",
      "redirectUri": "http://localhost:3000/api/kick/callback"
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 3000,
    "host": "localhost"
  }
}
```

Mutable settings live in `settings.json`, including `demo`, `chat.*`, `stream.*`, `platforms.youtube.setup`, `platforms.<provider>.showViewers`, and TUI/WebUI display preferences.

### Features
- OAuth authentication flows for all platforms
    * Twitch: real OAuth2 Authorization Code flow — visit `GET /api/twitch/auth` to initiate, callback handled at `GET /api/twitch/callback`
    * YouTube: real OAuth2 Authorization Code flow — visit `GET /api/youtube/auth` to initiate, callback handled at `GET /api/youtube/callback`; TUI `/connect youtube` returns a redirect URL via `POST /api/connect/youtube`
    * Kick: real OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow — visit `GET /api/kick/auth` to initiate, callback handled at `GET /api/kick/callback`; TUI `/connect kick` returns a redirect URL via `POST /api/connect/kick`, and opens a credentials setup modal if `clientId`/`clientSecret` are missing
- Unified chat interface with platform-specific message normalization
- Persistent message log: all incoming chat messages are appended to a SQLite database at `YASH_DATA_DIR/messages.db`; survives restarts; used by the chatter info modal to show per-user cross-session message history (up to 200 messages per user)
- Stream control (start/stop/update metadata)
- Stream markers / chapter points
    * `PlatformProvider.createMarker(description?, timestamp?)` — creates a marker on the platform
    * `PlatformProvider.getMarkers(options?)` — retrieves past markers (filterable by videoId)
    * `StreamMarker` type: `{ id, createdAt, description, positionInSeconds, platform, videoId?, url? }`
    * YouTube: in-memory store with chapter description serialisation helper; markers are also persisted in the runtime `settings.json` under `stream.chapters`, and if no explicit timestamp is supplied, markers use the current live elapsed time when `streamStartTime` is known, fall back to a live API lookup when needed, and each marker immediately re-syncs the live description timestamp block
    * Twitch: real Helix API (stream must be live); includes position and VOD URL
    * Kick: returns `null` / `[]` gracefully (not supported by Kick API)
- Webhook/event handling for real-time updates (Twitch EventSub WebSocket)
- OBS-studio WebSocket integration
- Platform selector for targeted messaging
- Demo mode: all services report as connected/authenticated without real network connections. Enabled via `"demo": true` in the runtime `settings.json` or `YASH_DEMO=true` env var. Disabled by default. TUI shows a `[DEMO MODE]` label in the status bar; `/api/obs/status` includes `"demo": true`.

### Key types (`src/platforms/base.ts`)

```typescript
interface StreamMetadata {
  title?: string;
  game?: string;
  description?: string;
  scheduleId?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  twitchGame?: string;      // Twitch-specific category (overrides game)
  kickCategory?: string;    // Kick-specific category (overrides game)
  youtubeCategory?: string; // YouTube video category name
}

interface StreamMarker {
  id: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  description: string;
  positionInSeconds: number;
  platform: string;
  videoId?: string;  // VOD ID (Twitch)
  url?: string;      // Deep-link to marker position in VOD (Twitch)
}

interface ChatterInfo {
  platform: string;
  userId: string;
  username: string;
  color?: string;
  badges?: Record<string, string>;
  accountCreatedAt?: Date | null;
  description?: string | null;
  profileImageUrl?: string | null;
  subscriberCount?: number | null;
  videoCount?: number | null;
  sessionMessageCount: number;
  sessionFirstSeenAt?: Date;
}

interface GetMarkersOptions {
  videoId?: string;
  limit?: number;
}

interface PlatformProvider {
  authenticate(): Promise<AuthResult>;
  isAuthenticated(): boolean;
  logout(): Promise<void>;
  updateStreamMetadata(metadata: StreamMetadata): Promise<MetadataUpdateResult>;
  getStreamKey(): string;
  getStreamStatus(): StreamStatus;
  sendMessage(message: string): Promise<void>;
  onMessage(callback: (msg: ChatMessage) => void): () => void;
  setupWebhooks(config: WebhookConfig): Promise<void>;
  getPlatformName(): string;
  getStatus(): PlatformStatus;
  getViewerCount(): number;
  createMarker(description?: string, timestamp?: number): Promise<StreamMarker | null>;

  fetchChatterInfo?(userId: string, username: string): Promise<ChatterInfo | null>;
}

// Note: setStreamKey / startStream / stopStream are YouTube-specific or removed.
// YouTube exposes setStreamKey(); Twitch and Kick use OAuth only (no RTMP key needed).

### Runtime dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@opentui/core`, `@opentui/react` | Terminal UI framework |
| `react`, `react-dom` | React for the web dashboard |
| `@twurple/auth` | Twitch OAuth2 + token refresh |
| `@twurple/api` | Twitch Helix API client |
| `@twurple/chat` | Twitch IRC-over-WebSocket chat |
| `@twurple/eventsub-ws` | Twitch EventSub WebSocket listener |
| `@nekiro/kick-api` | Kick OAuth 2.1 PKCE + channels/chat API client |

## Integration tests
- Chats webview with `playwright-cli` skill, record screenshots in [tmp]/web/
- TUI with `vhs` skill, record demos in [tmp]/tui/
- Use `YASH_DATA_DIR/config.json` and `YASH_DATA_DIR/settings.json` (actual working runtime state) to execute integration tests
- Test websocket communication with obs-studio (ignore if connection refused, aka obs-studio is off)

## Development Commands
- `bun run src/index.tsx` - Launch the TUI application
- `bun run src/index.ts` - Launch the web server only
- `bun run start` - Launch both TUI and web server concurrently
- `bun test` - Run unit tests only (fast, skips lint/typecheck)
- `bun run test` - Full check: lint → typecheck → tests
- `bun typecheck` - Type-check only (`bun --bun tsc --noEmit`)
- `bun run cmd <command> [args...]` - Send a command to the running yash TUI via IPC (e.g. `bun run cmd /marker "Intro | 0"`)
- `biome check --write` - Lint and format code

## Release Automation
- GitHub Actions builds a Linux x86_64 AppImage on pushed tags matching `v*`
- Tag-triggered AppImage builds publish the resulting `.AppImage` file to the matching GitHub release
- GitHub Actions also runs one nightly AppImage build per day on a schedule and uploads the `.AppImage` as a workflow artifact
